Number inversions

Rahul is facing a unique problem, which he doesn't know how to solve. The problem asks him to build the smallest possible number
by applying inversion on any digit of the number any number of times.
Inversion of a digit is defined as that digit being replaced by (9-digit).

The final output should not have any leading zeroes.

Input Format:
The only line of the input contains an integer N

Output Format:
Print only one single integer on a line as described above.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^18​​​​​​​

Examples:
Input:
87
Output:
12

Explanation:
12 is the smallest possible number.

Example:
Input:
99
Output:
90

Explanation:
We cannot have leading zeroes hence 90 is the answer in this case.
