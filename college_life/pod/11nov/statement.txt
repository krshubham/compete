You are talking with a stranger in a chat room. The stranger does not know how to type, so when typing a word, he can make mistakes and type 
unnecessary characters, which means several unwanted letters can be deleted in between. You have to find whether the stranger was able to say "hello" or not.

For Example "oheello", in this string the stranger is able to say hello,
but in this string "helol" he is not able to say hello.

Input Format:
There is only one line in the input which contains the string typed by the stranger

Output Format:
Print only one line,
"YES" if the stranger managed to say hello , or,
"NO" if the stranger wasn't able. (without quotes)
